# Predicting Streetcar Delays 

## About The Project

In this project I am going to solve a problem of predicting streetcar delays in Toronto,
Canada. The problem to solve is how to predict delays in the streetcar system so they
can be avoided. When a streetcar gets blocked, it can cause compound delays in the streetcar network and
contribute to overall gridlock on the city’s busiest streets. 
I am going to use a publicly available dataset that describes every delay encountered in the
streetcar system in Toronto since January 2014.
