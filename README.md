# Predicting Streetcar Delays 

## About The Project

In this project I am going to solve a problem of predicting streetcar delays in Toronto,
Canada. The problem to solve is how to predict delays in the streetcar system so they
can be avoided. When a streetcar gets blocked, it can cause compound delays in the streetcar network and
contribute to overall gridlock on the city’s busiest streets. 

## Dataset

I am going to use a publicly available dataset that describes every delay encountered in the
streetcar system in Toronto since January 2014.

“TTC Streetcar Delay Data"  
https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/ttc-streetcar-delay-data/

The data set is represented by XLS files for each year and the XLS file from each year contains Sheets for each month.
There is a table with columns in each sheet

• Report Date             
• Route           
• Time            
• Day         
• Location        
• Incident            
• Min Delay           
• Min Gap           
• Direction           
• Vehicle         


## Languages and technologies used

• Implementation is in Python 3.7.        
• Code was written using Anaconda, The Jupyter Notebook.              
• Other packages and libraries used: Matplotlib, NumPy, pandas, tensorflow, scikit-learn, Keras.          


## Used methods
